<div id="fbnotes">Some notes about the Facebook page</div>
<p>Obviously Facebook's source code and html is way more complex but it also does a whole lot more than my page. There are options there that just aren't on my page such as the ability to upload, download, and obviously a lot of links to a lot of different places</p>
