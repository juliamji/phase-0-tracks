## jQuery plan

- go through a guided tutorial
- practice important or unclear concepts as often as necessary
- take a couple of breaks to ensure my mind stays fresh
- just approaching it from a newbie's POV

+To make sure code runs after DOM is finished
	-jQuery(document).ready(function(){
	 $("h1").text("where to?"); 
	}); 
	-$(function() {
    $( "span" ).text( "$100" );
  });

+Loading jquery in html
	-<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
