#pseudocode
#we need a game class with several methods
#something to capture the secret word
#split or do chars on the word and have that stored
#if the letter guessed matches a character, print that character in its proper position to the screen
#if the guess does not match a character, decease/decrement the amount of turns by 1
#number of guesses should correspond to the word's length
